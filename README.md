# About
This is a simple WinForms application to view NUnit .XML results. This is a fork of https://sourceforge.net/projects/nunittrviewer/ and the original author is `yoursen` (Yuriy Seniuk?).

## Why fork?
It was built against an old .NET that wasn't available on some build machines. Rather than installing .NET, thought it would be good to refresh this build.
